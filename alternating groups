An alternating group is every k contiguous tiles in the circle with alternating colors (each tile in the group except the first and last one has a different color from its left and right tiles).

Return the number of alternating groups.

Note that since colors represents a circle, the first and the last tiles are considered to be next to each other.

    def numberOfAlternatingGroups(self, colors, k):
        w = 1
        ans = 0
        n = len(colors)
        for i in range(1, n+k-2 + 1):
            if colors[i % n] != colors[(i - 1 + n) % n]:
                w += 1
            else:
                w = 1
            if w >= k:
                ans += 1
        return ans
